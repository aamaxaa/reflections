The data of tipping and food price is visualized. This is a comparison of what the minimum wage for tipped service worker to cost of food and average menu price. The states with lower food cost at the top, which also happen to be ones with the lowest minimum wage for tipped service workers. At the bottom we see the opposite. This show that it isn't the case that lower cost due to lower food cost and lower minimum leads to lower average menu price.

The states with the higher average menu prices tend to be tourist attraction or far away. E.g. New York, Florida, Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada (Las Vegas).
